### 2022-06-27
     Dev:
      - Dane
      - Josef
Duration: 4hrs
   Tasks:
   - Refactored the refactoring (some changes needed to be reverted)
   - Refactoring introduced a bug where the correct fragment types would not display
   - Added Edible Log to the hierarchy
   - Fixed an issue where false information was getting assigned to an edible in the Edible Log instance (crashed)
   - Fixed ArrayLists, entires need to be downcasted to a single type to go in (shifted from ListItem, to EdibleLog to Edible)
   - Fixed an issue where the add button would reappear multiple times
   - Made the add button get added in the UI as opposed to the database
   - Fixed a bug where the add button would not appear in the list
   - Fixed a bug where an empty list was not accepted in an EdibleLog food's list, this is now true since empty logs are possible
   
   Remaining bugs:
   - Calories do not get updated as the log gets updated (fixed)
   - Calories need their own variables (food accumulated calories and exercise should be seperated) (fixed)
   - Data stub data should appear normally on the UI (fixed)
   - Data stub should have more interesting data (fixed)
   - "" needs to be checked before parsing for calories and workout calories (crashes) (fixed)
   - Should probably change quantity from int to double
